# SNS

The SNS library provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with message queues using the Provider interface, which internally contains the Producer and Receiver interfaces. This library allows you to send and receive messages to and from a specific provider, making it easy to work with various URL schemes.

## Introduction

The SNS library provides a set of interfaces and functions to work with message queues. It abstracts the underlying implementation details, allowing you to interact with different providers in a unified manner. The central concept of this library is the Provider interface, which combines the functionalities of both the Producer and Receiver interfaces.

### Producer Interface

The Producer interface is used to send messages to a specific provider. It defines the following methods:

* Send(*url.URL, Message, ...Option) error: Sends an individual message to the specified URL.
* SendBatch(*url.URL, []Message, ...Option) error: Sends a batch of messages to the specified URL.

### Receiver Interface

The Receiver interface provides functions for receiving messages from a specific provider. It defines the following methods:

* Receive(*url.URL, ...Option) (Message, error): Performs an on-demand receive of a single message from the specified URL. The behavior of this function may or may not wait for messages to arrive, depending on the implementation.
* ReceiveBatch(*url.URL, ...Option) ([]Message, error): Performs an on-demand receive of a batch of messages from the specified URL. Similarly, the behavior may or may not wait for messages to arrive.
* Additionally, the Receiver interface allows you to register listeners for messages using the AddListener(*url.URL, func(msg Message), ...Option) error method.

### Provider Interface

The Provider interface includes both the Producer and Receiver interfaces, providing a unified interface to interact with message queues. It defines the following methods:

* Producer: Includes the methods from the Producer interface.
* Receiver: Includes the methods from the Receiver interface.
* Schemes() []string: Returns an array of URL schemes supported by the provider.
* Setup(): Performs any necessary setup for the provider.
* NewMessage(string, ...Option) (Message, error): Creates a new message that can be used by clients, expecting the scheme to be provided.

## Installation

To install the SNS library, you can use the following go get command:

```go
go get go.nandlabs.io/commons-aws/sns
```

## Usage

To use the SNS library in your Go project, import the package and register your provider.

```go
package main

import (
 "context"

 "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
 "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
 "go.nandlabs.io/commons-aws/sns"
)

type SnsSessionProvider struct {
 region string
}

func (snsSessionProvider *SnsSessionProvider) Get() (*aws.Config, error) {
 sess, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.Background(), config.WithRegion(snsSessionProvider.region))
 return &sess, err
}

func main() {
 pvd := &SnsSessionProvider{
  region: "us-east-2",
    }
 // Create a new instance of the SQS provider
 sqs.AddSessionProvider(pvd.region, pvd)

 // ...
}
```

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the SNS library:

1. Sending a message to SNS topic

    ```go
    package main
   
    import "go.nandlabs.io/commons-aws/sns"
   
    func main() {
        snsProver := &sns.ProviderSNS{}
        url := &url.URL{Scheme: "sns", Host: "example.com/topic"}
        message := sqs.NewMessage("Hello, SNS!")
        err := snsProver.Send(url, message)
        if err != nil {
        // Handle the error
        }
    }
    ```
